        <p id="text_aboutme">
          I am from Copenhagen, Denmark, where I’m currently doing an AP in
          Multimedia Design in the international class. I really enjoy the
          creative process, though I find it much more challenging than coding,
          which is more logical and “safe”. Therefore, I choose the Digital
          Design and Content elective this semester, to challenge myself a bit
          and get out of my comfort zone. I’ve really enjoyed it so far, and
          sometimes we even dive into the psychological/sociological aspects of
          design and communication, which I LOVE.

              with a variety of people with different backgrounds, classes,

              the late 90's needed, to show the <b>imperfections</b> of the
              30'somethings. <b>She is wild, she is messy, she is a woman</b>.
              And together with Bridget Jones, she portraits a relatability that

              <h4>Animation, 1st Semester</h4>

              <p>
                Though the quality of the name is questionable, this was a great
                project, where we really were given much creative freedom and
                were shown how fun Multimedia Design can truly be! It was a solo
                project, and though I don't agree completely with this
                psychological approch anymore, it was so inspiring to be able to
                take the project in a direction that really interest me. And
                though it quickly became clear that my game stood out from the
                rest a bit, it's still one of the projects that I am the
                proudest of, to this day.

              <h4>Basic UX, 1st Semester</h4>
              <p>
                The Cherry Pop project was fun. It was a bit of an awkward topic
                and because the theme of the project was User Expeience, the
                main focus was to research and do surveys to create a solution
                that would satisfy the user. This was incredibly interesting
                because we dug a bit and found out where some of the shame
                behind the topic comees from. I came up with the "A Letter To
                Sex" section, where we had the participants write a letter to
                sex, which is probably the thing I'm the most proud of in this
                project. We were also able to work with the
                Psychological/Sociological aspects of the topic, which we all
                found very interesting, as well as creating an aesteically
                pleasing end result.

              <p>
                Our 3rd semester exam project was cool because we got to work
                with a real life client and it demanded incredible thoroughness.
                At this point, we had also improved drastically compared to 1st
                semester and the projected included pretty much everything we
                had learned from advanced coding to content creating to writing
                100 pages report to finish it off.
